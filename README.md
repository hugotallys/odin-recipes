# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

This project involves building a basic recipe website using core HTML concepts. The primary goal is to develop a solid understanding of how HTML structures content on the web and to apply those concepts in a practical way.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to have a deeper understanding of:

* HTML tags and their hierarchy: Organizing content using appropriate HTML elements for better readability.
* Linking content between webpages: Referencing and navigating across different pages within a website using URLs.
* Basic page layout and structure: Ensuring that content is logically structured and accessible.
