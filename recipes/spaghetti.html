    <h2 class="white">Ingredients</h2>
    <p>This recipe yields <strong>4 servings</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="red">Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring
            occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a
            pasta bowl.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet.</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil
            begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown, about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta.</li>
        <li>Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano
            cheese. Toss until combined.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
